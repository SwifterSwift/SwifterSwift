This version adds **more than 90 new extensions** making it the widest extensions library available online for Swift 3 with **more than 360 properties and methods for more than 35 type**.
This is the biggest update since library launch! We're so excited 🤓

Here are some changes:

- Added default values to methods parameters (where possible).
- All units documentation has been re-written in Xcode,
  - Now you see "**SwifterSwift:** " at the beginning of description to know the source of the extension while writing your code.
  - All method parameters and return types have been documented in Xcode as well.
  - All extensions documentation has been re-written in [Wiki](https://github.com/omaralbeik/SwifterSwift/wiki), separating properties from methods in different tables.
- All extensions files re-organized in separate extensions based on type (properties, methods, initializers, ..)
- Fixed some bugs where some extensions were not public.
- New section explaining how to add new extensions in [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/omaralbeik/SwifterSwift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- And finally: new logo
