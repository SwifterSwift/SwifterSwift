- Added default values to methods parameters (where possible).
- All units documentation has been re-written in Xcode,
    - Now you see "**SwifterSwift:** " at the beginning of description to know the source of the extension while writing your code.
    - All method parameters and return types have been documented in Xcode as well.
    - All extensions documentation has been re-written in [Wiki](https://github.com/omaralbeik/SwifterSwift/wiki), separating properties from methods in different tables.
- All extensions files re-organized in separate extensions based on type (properties, methods, initializers, ..)
- Fixed some bugs where some extensions were not public.
- New section explaining how to add new extensions in [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/omaralbeik/SwifterSwift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- And finally: new logo
