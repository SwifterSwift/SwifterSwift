## Asking Questions

We don't use GitHub as a support forum.
For any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself, please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead with the tag SwifterSwift.
By doing so, you'll be more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you'll allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer.
This also allows us to focus on improving the project for others.

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute to the project in a variety of ways:

- Improve documentation 🙏
- Add more extensions 👍
- Add missing unit tests 😅
- Fixing or reporting bugs 😱

If you're new to Open Source or Swift the SwifterSwift community is a great place to get involved

**Your contribution is always welcomed, no contribution is too small.**

## Adding new Extensions

Please refer to the following rules before submitting a pull request with your new extensions:

- Add your contributions to [**master branch** ](https://github.com/SwifterSwift/SwifterSwift/tree/master):
	- by doing this we can merge new pull-requests into **master** branch as soon as they are accepted, and add them to the next releases once they are fully tested.
- Mention the original source of extension source (if possible) as a comment inside extension:

 ```swift
public extension SomeType {
    public name: SomeType {
        // https://stackoverflow.com/somepage
        // .. code
    }
}
 ```

- All extensions should follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/403/)
- Always declare extensions as **public**.
- All extensions names should be as clear as possible.
- All extensions should be well documented. see [Adding documentation](#adding-documentation)
- Avoid using custom classes and objects the goal for this library is to extend the standards types available natively in Swift, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.
- extensions could be:
 	- enums
	- Properties & static properties
	- Methods & static methods
	- Initializers
- Files are named based on the type that the contained extensions extend (example: all String extensions are found in "**StringExtensions.swift**" file)
- extensions are ordered inside files in the following order:

```swift
// MARK: - enums
public enum {
    // ...
}

// MARK: - Properties
public extension SomeType {}

// MARK: - Methods
public extension SomeType {}

// MARK: - Initializers
public extension SomeType {}
```

- Please add each extension in its appropriate place in the file.

## Adding documentation

Use the following template to add documentation for extensions
> Replace placeholders inside <>

> Remove any extra lines, eg. if method does not return any value, delete the `- Returns:` line

#### Documentation template for units with single parameter:

```swift
/// SwifterSwift: <Description>.
///
///    <Example Code>
///
/// - Parameter <Paramenter>: <Description>.
/// - Throws: <Error>
/// - Returns: <Description>
```


#### Documentation template for units with multiple parameters:

```swift
/// SwifterSwift: <Description>.
///
///    <Example Code>
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - <Paramenter>: <Description>.
///   - <Paramenter>: <Description>.
/// - Throws: <Error>
/// - Returns: <Description>
```


#### Documentation template for enums:

```swift
/// SwifterSwift: <Description>.
///
/// - <Case1>: <Description>
/// - <Case2>: <Description>
/// - <Case3>: <Description>
/// - <Case4>: <Description>
```

#### Documentation Examples:

```swift

/// SwifterSwift: Sum of all elements in array.
///
///    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sum() -> 15
///
/// - Returns: Sum of the array's elements.
public func sum() -> Element {
    // ...
}

/// SwifterSwift: Date by changing value of calendar component.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - component: component type.
///   - value: new value of component to change.
/// - Returns: original date after changing given component to given value.
public func changing(_ component: Calendar.Component, value: Int) -> Date? {
    // ...
}

```

#### Power Tip:

In Xcode select a method and press `command` + `alt` + `/` to create a documentation template!

We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.

Check that the project issues database doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue.
If you find a match, add a quick "**+1**" or "**I have this problem too**".
Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.


**When reporting issues, please include the following:**

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened instead?
- SwifterSwift version
- Xcode version
- macOS version running Xcode
- Swift version
- Platform(s) running SwifterSwift
- Demo Project (if available)

This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
